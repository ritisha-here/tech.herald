             <p>In a remarkable demonstration of its capabilities, Sony's microsurgery robot has successfully performed surgery on a corn kernel, showcasing its precision and dexterity in the field of super-microsurgery. This innovative robot is designed to assist surgeons in operating on extremely small blood vessels and nerves, with diameters well under 1 mm (0.04 in).<br>
                
                The robot's precision is made possible by its advanced camera and TV technology, which provides a low-latency remote surgery device. The surgeon uses a pair of squeeze-sensitive, pen-like controllers and watches the real-life effects through a tiny, stereoscopic 4K 3D camera system. This feeds real-time vision through to a pair of OLED screens, effectively creating a strapless, desk-mounted set of VR goggles that the surgeon rests their face in.<br>
                <br>
                What sets Sony's robot apart is its ability to auto-switch between several instruments, allowing for minimal interruption to the work. On request, it'll quickly move a given arm back up to a little caddy, and switch tools, returning to the operating site within 10 seconds. This feature is particularly useful in super-microsurgery, where every second counts.<br>
                
                Surgeons who have tested the robot have been impressed with its performance. Dr. Hisako Hara noted that she was able to operate the robot with the same sense of handling forceps and scissors as in regular surgery. Dr. Makoto Mihara praised the robot's ability to move as he wanted it to, feeling like an assimilation between himself and the robot.<br>
                <br> 
                The robot's capabilities were put to the test at Achi Medical University (AMU) in February, where it demonstrated its ability to open up super-microsurgery to non-superhumans. Doctors and medical staff not specialized in microsurgery were able to perform an anastomosis – creating a surgical connection between two tubes – on animal blood vessels about 0.6 mm (0.02 in) in diameter.<br>
                
                The results were exceptional, with the robot enabling inexperienced physicians to perform intricate and delicate tasks with adeptness akin to that of seasoned experts. Professor Munekazu Naito of AMU noted that it takes months to years of extensive training for even skilled physicians to master this technique, but with Sony's surgical assistance robot technology, novice microsurgeons were able to achieve remarkable results.<br>
                
                Sony plans to continue R&D work to improve the machine and verify its effectiveness, with the ultimate goal of contributing to the advancement of medicine by providing robotic technologies. The company hopes that the compact nature of their robot and its control console will allow the device to be used in a range of tough settings, from cramped hospitals to disaster sites.<br>
                <br> 
                The successful demonstration of Sony's microsurgery robot on a corn kernel is a promising step forward in the field of precision surgery. With its advanced technology and ability to assist surgeons in performing complex procedures, this robot has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach super-microsurgery</p>
