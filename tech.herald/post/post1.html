                <p>The best standalone, consumer-oriented VR headset you can get right now. With a slimmer design, sharper display, more powerful processor, full-colour passthrough for mixed-reality gaming, and better controllers, the Quest 3 is clearly a superior headset when compared to its three-year-old predecessor.<p>

                <p>Meta Quest 3 – Design and Features</p>
                <p>The Meta Quest 3 arrives in a deceptively small, rather spartan looking box. The contents include the headset itself, a pre-installed foam facial interface, two Touch Plus controllers with pre-installed wrist straps and AA batteries, an 18W power adapter, and a USB Type-C charging cable for the headset itself. the ergonomics have been improved. The Quest 2 isn’t the most comfortable headset for long gaming sessions because the facial interface is pressed against your temples and cheeks, which isn’t nearly as comfortable as the PS VR2’s halo-style head strap that rests on top of your head. The Quest 3 still mounts the same way as the 2, but it protrudes out from your head by about an inch less than before, which means it feels less front-heavy. The soft, cloth head strap has also been redesigned so that it’s easier to adjust, and it does a good job of keeping the headset firmly in place without applying too much pressure. <br> 
                    <br> 
                  The audio system on the Quest 3 is similar to that found on the Quest 2, meaning it sits away from your ear. That said, it is not the same: there’s a lot less distortion than before, and the sound can be pumped up to a pretty deafening volume – it just means that, unlike with over-the-ear headphones or earbuds, people around you can hear a lot more of what’s going on. There’s also a 3.5mm audio jack so you can use wired earbuds or headphones for better noise isolation and spatial audio.
