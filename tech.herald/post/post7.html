             <p> Quantum computing. Drug discovery. Fusion energy. Scientific computing and physics-based simulations are poised to make giant steps across domains that benefit humanity as advances in accelerated computing and AI drive the world’s next big breakthroughs.<br> 
                NVIDIA unveiled at GTC in March the NVIDIA Blackwell platform, which promises generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models (LLMs) at up to 25x less cost and energy consumption than the NVIDIA Hopper architecture.<br> 
                Blackwell has powerful implications for AI workloads, and its technology capabilities can also help to deliver discoveries across all types of scientific computing applications, including traditional numerical simulation. By reducing energy costs, accelerated computing and AI drive sustainable computing. Many scientific computing applications already benefit.<br> 
                <br> 
                Scientific computing and physics-based simulation often rely on what’s known as double-precision formats, or FP64 (floating point), to solve problems. Blackwell GPUs deliver 30% more FP64 and FP32 FMA (fused multiply-add) performance  than Hopper.<br>
                Rosenblatt analysts called Nvidia's Blackwell platform the "most ambitious project in Silicon Valley" after the chipmaker unveiled its latest artificial intelligence (AI) tech at its annual GPU Technology Conference.<br> 
                "NVIDIA continues to dominate the AI value chain with its full-stack turnkey (hardware, software, systems, services, developers) model," Bank of America analysts said, adding that other companies within Nvidia's AI ecosystem could also benefit.<br> 
                Huang "ushered in the new Industrial Revolution of Gen AI as an industry focused on accelerated computing built on the backbone of the new Blackwell GPU platform," Rosenblatt analysts said, adding that Blackwell is "the most ambitious project in Silicon Valley."<br> 
                Nvidia didn't provide pricing or a specific launch date for the new products as some analysts anticipated but did say Blackwell would be available through its partners, including Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, later this year.<br> 
                There is already high demand for the new products, the company said. Rosenblatt analysts indicated that they "believe Blackwell is sold out well into 2025 amid improving Hopper supply."<br> 
                The Blackwell GPU "offers an easy upgrade path," for customers using its predecessor, which Wedbush analysts said "in of itself could create significant demand for NVDA's next generation of parts."<br> 
                <br> 
                New Blackwell accelerators and networking will deliver leaps in performance for advanced simulation.<br> 
                The NVIDIA GB200 kicks off a new era for high-performance computing (HPC). Its architecture sports a second-generation transformer engine optimized to accelerate inference workloads for LLMs.<br> 
                This delivers a 30x speedup on resource-intensive applications like the 1.8-trillion-parameter GPT-MoE (generative pretrained transformer-mixture of experts) model compared to the H100 generation, unlocking new possibilities for HPC. By enabling LLMs to process and decipher vast amounts of scientific data, HPC applications can sooner reach valuable insights that can accelerate scientific discovery.<br> 
                "The new products are likely to trigger an upgrade cycle for key customers and benefit supply chain companies exposed to GPU servers, liquid cooling, and memory products," Bank of America analysts said.<br> 
                Blackwell could help Nvidia to "continue to support near-term momentum for AI-related stocks," UBS analysts said, adding that the firm positively views "the broader AI trend."<br> 
                This is the understanding as the market and various analysts hold , and at the launch of the product the price at the time has touched a high of $893.98. They have more than tripled in value over the past year . <br>
