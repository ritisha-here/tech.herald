                Generative AI can learn from existing artifacts to generate new, realistic artifacts (at scale) that reflect the characteristics of the training data but don’t repeat it. It can produce a variety of novel content, such as images, video, music, speech, text, software code and product designs.  <br> 
                Generative AI uses a number of techniques that continue to evolve. Foremost are AI foundation models, which are trained on a broad set of unlabeled data that can be used for different tasks, with additional fine-tuning. Complex math and enormous computing power are required to create these trained models, but they are, in essence, prediction algorithms. <br> 
                <br> 
                BUT WHAT IS THE HYPE!<br> 
                It becomes clearer when you set aside the doomsayers of AI and the pundits declaring utopia is five minutes away. There’s nothing inherently wrong with all the hype, but it is helpful to understand what the reality is versus doing a lot of worrying.<br> 
                The financial reasons for the AI Hype<br> 
                Publicly Traded Companies: Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple are all publicly traded companies. Their primary role is to deliver shareholder value, known as dividends. Customer focus? In the early days. Not anymore. With consumer spending on technology slowing, they need a stock lift. If they don’t have an AI solution to bring to market after what OpenAI did, the stock will fall, dividends will fall, CEOs can lose their jobs.<br> 
                Startups: OpenAI was a non-profit to start. It is now a corporation. AI (Large Language Models in this case) is very expensive to operate. Partnering with a tech giant was critical to the training phase. For OpenAI, that’s been Microsoft. Now that they seem to have a business model and are corporate, they can raise money. And deliver shareholder value.<br> 
                Market Mover Positioning<br> 
                Secondarily, but playing into the money side of things, is tech giants jostling for market position. LLM tools like ChatGPT will impact marketing as well as search. The new Bing enhanced with ChatGPT is really cool. It makes Google look like it never left 1999. Google knows this. So far, it has failed to innovate. LLM, or Generative AI (GAI) is not about to take everyones jobs away, nor will it take over the world. That’s silly hyperbole for clickbait news headlines. But it will play a major role and could actually end up solving what Information Technology hasn’t done; increase productivity.<br> 
                Academics & Non-Profits<br> 
                Yes, there is significant societal risk from various AI tools like LLMs, Neural Networks and Machine Learning, especially if they are combined in novel ways. But academic institutions and non-profits serving the public good need money to operate too. Investment capital doesn’t tend to flow to them unless there’s a path to profit. <br> 
                <br> 
                A.I. Scammers & Snake Oil<br> 
                The ads and posts riddle social media channels like a stream of unicorn vomit and sparkly rainbows. Suddenly, these brilliant minds can tell you how to make $100,000 a month using ChatGPT, which of course, they’ve proven in just the few months it’s been available. Or how if you use A.I a certain way you can 300x your productivity, which would translate to “hit the any key and go back to sleep and you’ll make millions.” This is all bump. Or B.S. if you like.<br> 
                All they want is your money. It’s like MLM and pyramid schemes. The guy at the top makes the money, the rest are the suckers. Don’t be one.<br> 
                So what can we take away from all of this?<br> 
                Artificial Intelligence is a marketing term that is doing what it’s supposed to do. Build a capital market. Doom or eternal sunshine, any news is good news.<br> 
                There is a ton of speculation on what AI will do, how it will change our world, either good or bad, depending on your camp. For the majority of earths population, as in 99.7%, they don’t understand AI is a marketing term and that there is no singular AI.<br> 
                Most of the world is figuring out how to deal with rising mortgage and rent payments and the insane cost of food. Worried about Russia’s brutal, insane war on Ukraine going nuclear and trying to move on from three years of lockdowns and political divisions.<br>
